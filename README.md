# Reward Multiplier MT4

This code is a semi-automatic trade manager that implements pyramid trading principles to maximize Forex profits while minimizing risk. It provides functions for opening additional orders using running trade profits, displaying potential profit/loss before placing the first trade, implementing a calculated risk management strategy, and maximizing Forex profits by opening new trades using profits from existing trades.

## Semi-Automatic Trade Management

The `OpenAdditionalOrders` function is responsible for opening additional orders using running trade profits. It implements pyramid trading principles to increase the position size as the trade progresses.

## Potential Profit/Loss Display

The `DisplayPotentialProfitLoss` function calculates and displays the potential profit/loss before placing the first trade. It also shows the reward to risk ratio for each trade, allowing traders to assess the potential returns relative to the risk involved.

## Risk Management

The `RiskManagementStrategy` function provides a clear and calculated risk management strategy. It prioritizes minimizing risk while maximizing returns, helping traders make informed decisions and protect their capital.

## Maximize Forex Profits

The `MaximizeForexProfits` function opens a new trade using the profit from the existing trade. It is called when a trade enters the profit zone, allowing traders to compound their profits and maximize their returns.

## Main Function

The `OnInit` function is the main entry point of the program. It calls the `DisplayPotentialProfitLoss` and `RiskManagementStrategy` functions to display potential profit/loss and implement the risk management strategy. It then simulates a trade entering the profit zone by setting the `existingTradeProfit` variable to a positive value and calling the `MaximizeForexProfits` function.

## Event Handling

The `OnTick` function handles tick events and is where traders can implement their trading logic. It allows for real-time decision-making based on market movements.

## Program Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit` function handles program deinitialization and performs any necessary cleanup actions.
